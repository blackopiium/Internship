			<p class="maintxt">We’re sitting in the new London SoulCycle studio. Surprisingly, it’s not a building site, 
despite the fact that it doesn’t open its doors for another couple of weeks which speaks volumes about the super slick operation that is SoulCycle. Hidden behind a big wooden façade branded with the recognisable SoulCycle yellow and the words “ London-this is going to be fun”, it hasn’t stopped people trying to take a sneak peek of the much antici-pated studio launch. Legendary amongst fitness communities, SoulCycle isn’t your av-erage exercise studio or company for that matter. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p class="pzag">What was your career journey before SoulCycle?</p>
<br><br>
<p class="maintxt">I moved to New York right after college and I worked for a hotel company called Starwood Hotels and my father was an entrepreneur and was always in client service businesses and I loved the idea of hospitality. I spent a couple of years there and then went on to Virgin and worked for Richard Branson’s investment arm on the team which started Virgin Americathe domestic air carrier in the US. I spent a lot of time in London when I was in my mid-twenties, that’s where I met my husband because he worked for Richard here in the UK. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<p class="pzag">What’s different about SoulCycle for anyone who isn’t familiar with the concept?</p>
<br><br>
<p class="maintxt">The first thing is that the classes are entirely unique. We scout for our instructors around the world and audition them – we call it American Idol on a bike – we go and pop up and audition hundreds of instructors to become part of our signature training programme and what we do is look for great talent that can hold the energy of the space and really connect with 60 people in a room. And then the class as it comes together is not just physical but it’s musical, emotional and inspirational and we put all of those pieces together to create an experience that really isn’t just about the workout, it’s much more about human connection and breakthrough and you viewing yourself in the mirror as stronger than you ever thought possible and a lot of that comes down to how we coach our instructors to be the best version of themselves as coaches. </p>
